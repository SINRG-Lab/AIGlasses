```

Dependency direction is strictly downward: the `.ino` orchestrates, `ble_link`
forwards inbound packets to `playback`, `playback` consumes `ring_buffer` and
`audio_io`. No module reaches back up.

## Data flows

### Recording (button held)
```
PDM mic ──I2S DMA──▶ micRead() ──▶ micFilter()        [main loop]
                                      │  DC-block high-pass (~80 Hz corner)
                                      ▼
                       bleSendMicChunk(): 'A'+seq framing, 509-byte fragments,
                       notifyWithRetry + 5 ms pacing ──BLE──▶ Android ASR
```

### TTS playback (Android → speaker)
```
Android ──BLE WRITE──▶ AudioRxCallbacks::onWrite()     [NimBLE task]
                          │ playbackOnAudioData()
                          ▼
                     ringWrite()  ◀── 256 KB PSRAM ring, lock-free SPSC
                          │
                     ringRead()   ──▶ mono→stereo interleave ──▶ speakerWrite()
                     [main loop: playbackTick()]                  I2S DMA → MAX98357A
```

State machine: `IDLE → BUFFERING` (on `'S'`) `→ PLAYING` (≥ 70 KB buffered, or `'E'`
arrived) `→ DRAINING` (on `'E'`) `→ IDLE`. An abort flag (barge-in / disconnect) is
set from any task but always **serviced in the main loop**, so I2S teardown never
races a concurrent `i2s_channel_write`.

### Photo / video
Snapshots are copied to a module-owned PSRAM buffer so the camera frame buffer
returns to the driver immediately. Video frames stream straight from the frame
buffer. Both share one fragmentation path in `ble_link`, entirely in-band on IMAGE_TX
(`'H'` header, `'I'`+seq fragments, `'J'` end marker) so no marker can be
reordered against the data it frames.

## Concurrency model

Two contexts touch shared state:

| Context | Runs | Touches |
|---|---|---|
| Main loop (Arduino task) | gestures, mic, camera, I2S feed, all BLE *sends* | everything |
| NimBLE host task | characteristic callbacks | ring buffer (write side), playback flags |

Safety comes from three rules:
1. The ring buffer is single-producer/single-consumer with `volatile` indices —
   aligned 32-bit loads/stores are atomic on the ESP32, so no locks are needed.
2. Playback control variables are `volatile` flags written by one side, read by the
   other; the only compound action (speaker teardown) happens exclusively in the
   main loop via the abort flag.
3. All BLE *notifications* originate from the main loop, so one shared packet
   scratch buffer (`sPkt`) is safe and replaces V1's variable-length stack arrays.

## Why the I2S ports are split (and the mic still pauses)

The S3 has two independent I2S controllers: PDM mic RX runs on `I2S_NUM_0`,
speaker STD TX on `I2S_NUM_1`. They *could* run simultaneously, but the always-on
PDM clock (GPIO42) crosstalks into the speaker BCLK line on the current board
layout, so the mic is paused during playback and resumed at teardown. The speaker
channel is created on demand and deleted after each playback, with the DIN line
driven low — residual I2S idle clocking otherwise produces audible amp hiss.

## Setup ordering (load-bearing)

1. **Camera first.** It claims DMA channels and PSRAM frame buffers; if the ring
   buffer or mic initialize first, `esp_camera_fb_get()` can permanently return NULL.
2. Ring buffer (PSRAM).
3. Button (with stuck-at-boot check), then mic init + warm-up flush.
4. BLE last — nothing can arrive before the receive path exists.
